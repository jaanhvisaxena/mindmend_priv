# Fix "Profile Not Found" Issue - Step by Step Guide

## üö® Problem
You're getting "Profile Not Found" error even after filling out the setup form.

## üîß Solution Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Database Tables
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `setup_database.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the script
5. You should see a table verification at the end showing all tables exist

### Step 2: Check Your Current Status
1. In the **SQL Editor**, run the `test_therapist_profile.sql` script
2. Look at the results to see:
   - Which tables exist
   - If your profile exists
   - If you have therapist data
   - What your current role is

### Step 3: Fix Your Profile (if needed)
If the test shows issues, run these commands in order:

```sql
-- 1. Ensure you have a profile with therapist role
INSERT INTO profiles (id, email, first_name, last_name, role)
VALUES (
    auth.uid(),
    'your-email@example.com',  -- Replace with your actual email
    'Your First Name',         -- Replace with your actual name
    'Your Last Name',          -- Replace with your actual name
    'therapist'
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET 
    role = 'therapist',
    first_name = COALESCE(profiles.first_name, 'Your First Name'),
    last_name = COALESCE(profiles.last_name, 'Your Last Name');

-- 2. Ensure you have therapist data
INSERT INTO therapists (id, specialization, license_number)
VALUES (
    auth.uid(),
    'General Therapy',  -- Replace with your specialization
    'YOUR123'          -- Replace with your license number
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 4: Test the Setup Form
1. Go back to your app
2. Navigate to `/setup-profile`
3. Fill out the form with your details
4. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
5. Go to the **Console** tab
6. Submit the form and watch for the debug messages:
   - `üîç Starting profile setup for user:`
   - `‚úÖ Profile updated successfully`
   - `‚úÖ Therapist data saved successfully`

### Step 5: Test the Dashboard
1. After successful profile setup, go to `/dashboard`
2. Check the browser console for debug messages:
   - `üîç Profile query result:`
   - `‚úÖ Therapist profile found:`
   - `‚úÖ Therapist data prepared:`

## üîç Debugging

### If Step 4 fails (Setup Form Issues):
Look for these console messages:
- `‚ùå Profile update error:` - Database permission issue
- `‚ùå Therapist save error:` - Therapists table issue
- `‚ùå Unexpected error:` - General error

### If Step 5 fails (Dashboard Issues):
Look for these console messages:
- `‚ùå User exists but role is not 'therapist':` - Role not set correctly
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Profile exists but no therapist data in therapists table` - Missing therapist data
- `‚ùå No therapist profile found` - Profile doesn't exist

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Fixes

### Fix 1: RLS Policy Issues
If you get permission errors, run:
```sql
-- Grant all permissions to authenticated users (for testing)
GRANT ALL ON profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON therapists TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON therapist_availability TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON appointments TO authenticated;
```

### Fix 2: Missing Tables
If tables don't exist, run the `setup_database.sql` script again.

### Fix 3: Wrong Role
If your role is not 'therapist', run:
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'therapist' WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### Fix 4: Missing Therapist Data
If you have a profile but no therapist data, run:
```sql
INSERT INTO therapists (id, specialization, license_number)
VALUES (auth.uid(), 'General Therapy', 'PENDING')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
1. ‚úÖ All tables exist in the database
2. ‚úÖ Profile exists with role = 'therapist'
3. ‚úÖ Therapist data exists in therapists table
4. ‚úÖ Setup form saves without errors
5. ‚úÖ Dashboard loads without "Profile Not Found" error
6. ‚úÖ You can see your therapist information in the dashboard

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If you're still having problems:

1. **Check the Network Tab** in browser dev tools for failed API calls
2. **Verify your Supabase URL and API key** in your environment variables
3. **Check if you're properly authenticated** by testing `supabase.auth.getUser()`
4. **Look for any TypeScript errors** that might be preventing the component from rendering
